# Pathsongs Open Vector Tiles â€“ Tilemaker Configuration and Style

This Git repository contains the Tilemaker configuration files in order to produce
vector tiles in a Shortbread derived schema.

* [Schema documentation](https://shortbread.geofabrik.de/schema/)

## Original Authors

This set of configuration files has been created for Geofabrik by Michael Reichert 
and Amanda McCann before it was put on Github. Further contributors may be visible 
in the git history.

## License and Copyright

Because this set of configuration files is intended to go with the tilemaker software,
it is released under the same license as tilemaker itself, the [FTWPL license](./LICENCE.txt).

## Deviations from the original tilemaker/versatiles configuration

1. Tilemaker: Added bridleways
2. Style: Removed filter on service=driveway
3. Changed colors/zoom levels to make paths more visible and at a wider range of zoom levels
4. Added layers to include national level bike/hike routes
